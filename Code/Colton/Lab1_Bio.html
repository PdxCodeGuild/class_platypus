    <p>Paul was born on the planet Caladan, the son of Duke Leto Atreides I and his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady
        Jessica and the older brother to Alia Atreides. He married Bene Gesserit trained Irulan Corrino, but
        did not produce an heir by her. With his Fremen concubine
        Chani Kynes, he fathered the twins Ghanima and Leto Atreides II, the God-Emperor. He was the last Duke of House
        Atreides, leader of the Fremen, and first ruler of the Atreides Empire. He was
        considered the Kwisatz Haderach: the powerful prescient being, long sought by the Bene Gesserit and product of
        their lengthy
        breeding program.</p>

    </ul>
    <p> Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building
        pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the Bene Gesserit, Bene Tleilax, fringe groups within
        the Fremen, and the dethroned but still powerful House Corrino. Among the schemes of his enemies were the
        detonation of a stone burner near where Paul and his forces stood in Arrakeen, which resulted in his physical
        blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having
        eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.</p>
