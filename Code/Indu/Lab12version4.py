#Guess the number:
# Objective: Tell the user whether their current guess is closer than their last. This can be done by maintaining a variable
# containing the last guess outside the loop, then comparing the last guess to the current guess, and check if it's closer.
#  Hint: you're interested in comparing the two absolute differences: abs(current_guess-target) and abs(last_guess-target)
